### dotwhisker
Solt, Frederick and Yue Hu. 2015. dotwhisker: Dot-and-Whisker Plots of Regression Results. The Comprehensive R Archive Network (CRAN). 

[![CRAN version](http://www.r-pkg.org/badges/version/dotwhisker)](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/dotwhisker/index.html) ![](http://cranlogs.r-pkg.org/badges/grand-total/dotwhisker)

`dotwhisker` is an R package for quickly and easily generating dot-and-whisker plots of regression results, either directly from model objects or from tidy data frames. It provides a convenient way to create highly customizable plots for presenting and comparing statistics. It can be used to plot coefficients or other estimates (e.g., predicted probabilities) within a model or compare them across different models. The estimates are presented as dots with confidence interval whiskers, and predictors can be grouped in brackets.

To install:

* the latest released version: `install.packages("dotwhisker")`.
* the latest development version: `devtools::install_github("fsolt/dotwhisker")`.

### interplot
Solt, Frederick and Yue Hu. 2015. interplot: Plot the Coefficients of Variables in Interaction Terms. The Comprehensive R Archive Network (CRAN).

[![CRAN version](http://www.r-pkg.org/badges/version/interplot)](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/interplot/index.html) ![](http://cranlogs.r-pkg.org/badges/grand-total/interplot)

`interplot` is a tool for plotting the conditional coefficients ("marginal effects") of variables included in multiplicative interaction terms. The function plots the changes in the coefficient of one variable in a two-way interaction term conditional on the value of the other included variable. The plot also includes simulated 95% confidential intervals of these coefficients.

To install:

* the latest released version: `install.packages("interplot")`.
* the latest development version: `devtools::install_github("sammo3182/interplot")`.
