Together with my coauthors, I have written R packages that have been installed hundreds of thousands of times by researchers working around the world.  Read more about them below.

## Visualization

### dotwhisker

`dotwhisker` is an R package for quickly and easily generating dot-and-whisker plots of regression results, either directly from model objects or from tidy data frames. It provides a convenient way to create highly customizable plots for presenting and comparing statistics. It can be used to plot coefficients or other estimates (e.g., predicted probabilities) within a model or compare them across different models. The estimates are presented as dots with confidence interval whiskers.

To install:

* the latest released version: `install.packages("dotwhisker")`.
* the latest development version: `remotes::install_github("fsolt/dotwhisker")`.

More details are available at:

### interplot

`interplot` is a tool for plotting the conditional coefficients ("marginal effects") of variables included in multiplicative interaction terms. The function plots the changes in the coefficient of one variable in a two-way interaction term conditional on the value of the other included variable. The resulting plot also includes simulated 95% confidential intervals of these coefficients.

To install:

* the latest released version: `install.packages("interplot")`.
* the latest development version: `remotes::install_github("sammo3182/interplot")`.

## Dynamic Comparative Public Opinion

### DCPOtools
Solt, Frederick, Yuehong Cassandra Tai, Yue Hu, Hyein Ko, and Byung-Deuk Woo. 2019. "`DCPOtools`: Tools for Preparing Survey Data for DCPO." <https://github.com/fsolt/DCPOtools>.

Dynamic Comparative Public Opinion (DCPO) analyses generate estimates of latent public opinion that are comparable across countries and over time from hundreds or thousands of surveys, but collecting and formatting these survey data is a formidable challenge.  The `DCPOtools` package streamlines these initial steps, providing tools for downloading survey datasets, extracting the needed data, correctly identifying and standardizing the countries and years surveyed, applying survey weights, and arranging the resulting information into the format required to generate DCPO estimates. 

To install:

`DCPOtools` is not available on CRAN.  Install its latest version with the following command: `remotes::install_github("fsolt/DCPOtools")`


### DCPO
Solt, Frederick. 2020. "`DCPO`: Dynamic Comparative Public Opinion."  The Comprehensive R Archive Network (CRAN).

[<img src="https://www.r-pkg.org/badges/version/DCPO">](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/DCPO/index.html)
<img src="https://cranlogs.r-pkg.org/badges/grand-total/DCPO"> <img src="https://cranlogs.r-pkg.org/badges/DCPO?color=orange">

The study of comparative public opinion has been hampered by data that is sparse, that is, unavailable for many countries and years; incomparable, i.e., ostensibly addressing the same issue but generated by different survey items; or, most often, both.  `DCPO` is an R package for estimating latent public opinion from cross-national survey data to maximize the information gleaned from available sources, overcome issues of missing and incomparable data, and allow comparativists to examine the dynamics of public opinion across countries.

For a detailed description, see [the paper here](https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/d5n9p/).

To install:

* the latest released version: `install.packages("DCPO", dependencies = TRUE)`
* the latest development version: `remotes::install_github("fsolt/DCPO", dependencies = TRUE)`

Note that `DCPO` depends on [`stan`](https://mc-stan.org). So, please install `rstan` and `rstantools` first. 
See the detailed instructions [here](https://github.com/stan-dev/rstan/wiki/RStan-Getting-Started). 

Windows users may encounter some issues when installing `DCPO` due to the version or system settings.
We recommend installing the [proper version](https://cran.r-project.org/web/checks/check_results_DCPO.html) of R and `Stanheaders` package first. 

**Note:** Development of CmdStan, available on R via [CmdStanR](https://mc-stan.org/cmdstanr/), has far outstripped that of the `rstan` package on which `DCPO` is based.  DCPO estimates can now be generated much, _much_ faster (wallclock times of < 2%) by passing [the DCPO Stan file](https://github.com/fsolt/DCPO/blob/master/inst/stan/dcpo.stan) to CmdStanR.  See [here for an example](https://github.com/fsolt/dcpo_trust_bureaucracy/blob/ba7f193a47ae6f0474e00bffd84ad8de6e5bf32e/paper/dcpo_trust_bureaucracy.Rmd#L419).
