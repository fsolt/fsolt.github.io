Together with my coauthors, I have written R packages that have been installed hundreds of thousands of times by researchers working around the world.  Read more about them below.

## Visualization

### dotwhisker

`dotwhisker` is an R package for quickly and easily generating dot-and-whisker plots of regression results, either directly from model objects or from tidy data frames. It provides a convenient way to create highly customizable plots for presenting and comparing statistics. It can be used to plot coefficients or other estimates (e.g., predicted probabilities) within a model or compare them across different models. The estimates are presented as dots with confidence interval whiskers.

To install:

* the latest released version: `install.packages("dotwhisker")`.
* the latest development version: `remotes::install_github("fsolt/dotwhisker")`.

More details are available at:

### interplot

`interplot` is a tool for plotting the conditional coefficients ("marginal effects") of variables included in multiplicative interaction terms. The function plots the changes in the coefficient of one variable in a two-way interaction term conditional on the value of the other included variable. The resulting plot also includes simulated 95% confidential intervals of these coefficients.

To install:

* the latest released version: `install.packages("interplot")`.
* the latest development version: `remotes::install_github("sammo3182/interplot")`.
