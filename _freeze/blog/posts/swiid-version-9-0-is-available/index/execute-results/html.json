This new release:\n\n- adds to [its source data](https://github.com/fsolt/swiid/blob/master/data/swiid_source.csv) 947 new Ginis since version 8.3, including newly available LIS data on [Greece, Lithuania, Russia, South Africa, the United States,](https://www.lisdatacenter.org/news-and-events/2020-summer-data-release/) [Ireland, Panama, and Switzerland](https://www.lisdatacenter.org/news-and-events/2020-autumn-data-splash/); and\n\n- includes estimates of market and disposable income inequality for 72 more country-years than version 8.3;\n\n- and, justifying the whole-number revision, it incorporates the [LIS' new guidance on topcoding](http://www.lisdatacenter.org/wps/techwps/9.pdf) (and so minimizes the extent to which income inequality is underestimated).
