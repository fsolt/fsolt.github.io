<p>Version 6.1 of the SWIID is <a href="http://fsolt.org/swiid/swiid_downloads.html">now available</a>! Building on the end-to-end revision accomplished in Version 6.0 last July, this new release:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>incorporates in <a href="https://github.com/fsolt/swiid/blob/master/data/swiid_source.csv">its source data</a> 280 new Ginis, including <a href="http://www.lisdatacenter.org/news-and-events/fall-data-release/">newly available LIS data on Canada and Lithuania</a>;</p></li>
<li><p>includes estimates of disposable income inequality for 83 new country-years;</p></li>
<li><p>expands estimates of market income inequality to <em>all</em> country-years (version 6.0 only estimated market income inequality for countries included in the LIS, about a third of the total country-years);</p></li>
<li><p>calculates estimates of absolute and relative redistribution for twenty additional countries, for a total of sixty-sixâ€”all of the countries for which there is source data available <a href="http://fsolt.org/blog/2015/10/05/redistribution-observations.html">on both the distribution of market income and the distribution of disposable income or consumption</a>.</p></li>
</ul>
