title: SWIID Version 5.1 is available!
---

Version 5.1 of the SWIID is [now available](/swiid/swiid_downloads/)!  It revises and updates the SWIID's source data and estimates.  It also includes expanded training modules explaining how to take into account the uncertainty in the estimates in both R and Stata.

As always, I encourage users of the SWIID to email me with their comments, questions, and suggestions.
