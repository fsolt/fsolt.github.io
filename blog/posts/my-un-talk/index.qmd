Earlier this month, I gave a talk previewing Version 4.0 of the SWIID to the [Development Policy and Analysis Division](http://www.un.org/en/development/desa/policy/index.shtml) of the United Nations' Department of Economic and Social Affairs. I had some great conversations and got lots of useful feedback. Slides for the talk can be found [here](/papers/swiid_un_talk/).
