Hu Yue and I just published [`interplot` on CRAN](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/interplot), our first R package. `interplot` makes graphing the coefficients of variables in interaction terms easy. It outputs `ggplot` objects, so further customization is simple. Check out [the vignette](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/interplot/vignettes/interplot-vignette.html) and give it a try!
