Earlier this month, I gave a talk previewing Version 4.0 of the SWIID to the <a href="http://www.un.org/en/development/desa/policy/index.shtml" rel="self">Development Policy and Analysis Division</a> of the United Nations' Department of Economic and Social Affairs.  I had some great conversations and got lots of useful feedback.  Slides for the talk can be found <a href="/papers/SWIID_UN_Talk" rel="self">here</a>.
