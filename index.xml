      <description>About I am an associate professor in the Department of Political Science at the University of Iowa. My interests include comparative political behavior and political economy from a cross-national perspective; I am also interested in computational methods for cross-national research. Much of my work focuses on understanding how&amp;mdash;and why&amp;mdash;the extent of economic inequality in a country shapes the attitudes and behavior of the people who live there. I also created and maintain the Standardized World Income Inequality Database (SWIID), which provides the most-comparable data available on income inequality for broadly cross-national research.</description>
