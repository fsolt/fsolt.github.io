      <title>Using Cross-Validation to Evaluate the Comparability of the SWIID&#39;s Estimates</title>

      <description>From its origins now over ten years ago, the goal of the Standardized World Income Inequality Database has been to provide estimates of income inequality for as many countries and years as possible while ensuring that these estimates are as comparable as the available data allow. That is to say, the SWIID’s first prority is breadth of coverage, and its second is comparability. The starting point for the SWIID estimates is a dataset with the complementary priorities: the Luxembourg Income Study, which aims to maximize comparability and, given that primary concern, to include as many countries and years as possible.</description>

      <description>Version 7.1 of the SWIID is now available! In addition to important behind-the-scenes improvements to the estimation routine, this new release:
 adds to its source data 627 new Ginis since version 6.2, including newly available LIS data on Chile, Germany, Hungary, Poland, and Israel; and
 includes estimates of market and disposable income inequality for 80 more country-years than version 6.2.
  For more details, you can check out the all the R and Stan code used to generate the estimates in the SWIID GitHub repository.</description>

      <description>Version 6.2 of the SWIID is now available! Building on the end-to-end revision accomplished in Version 6.0 last July and the update Version 6.1 last October, this new release:
 incorporates in its source data 560 new Ginis, including newly available LIS data on China, Germany, Paraguay, Taiwan, the United States, and Uruguay;
 includes estimates of market and disposable income inequality for 27 new country-years;
 calculates estimates of absolute and relative redistribution for one additional country, Latvia, for a total of sixty-seven—all of the countries for which there is source data available on both the distribution of market income and the distribution of disposable income or consumption.</description>

 incorporates in its source data 280 new Ginis, including newly available LIS data on Canada and Lithuania;
 includes estimates of disposable income inequality for 83 new country-years;
 expands estimates of market income inequality to all country-years (version 6.0 only estimated market income inequality for countries included in the LIS, about a third of the total country-years);</description>

      <description>Friday, 27 October 2017: Updated with information on the source data for SWIID Version 6.1
I have been producing the Standardized World Income Inequality Database for nearly a decade. Since 2008, the SWIID has provided estimates of the Gini index of income inequality1 for as many countries and years as possible and—given the primary goal of maximizing spatial and temporal coverage—these estimates are as comparable as the available data allow.</description>

      <description>A new working paper by IMF researchers Serhan Cevik and Carolina Correa-Caro observes that sharply rising inequality has made China one of the most unequal countries in the world. Here&amp;rsquo;s a graph of SWIIDv5.0 data that illustrates their point.</description>

      <description>Version 5.0 of the SWIID is now available, and it is a major update. A new article of record (currently available as a working paper while under peer review) reviews the problem of comparability in cross-national income inequality data, explains how the SWIID addresses the issue, assesses the SWIID&amp;rsquo;s performance in comparison to the available alternatives, and explains how to use the SWIID data in cross-national analyses.
The new version also marks the debut of the SWIID web application.</description>

      <description>Version 4.0 of the SWIID is now available here. Drawing on nearly 14,000 Gini observations in more than 3100 country-years, this version provides even better estimates of income inequality in countries around the world than in previous versions.
This version introduces two other improvements. First, many users have had trouble making appropriate use of the standard errors associated with the SWIID estimates. The uncertainty, however, can sometimes be substantial, making it crucial to incorporate in one&amp;rsquo;s analyses.</description>

      <description>Earlier this month, I gave a talk previewing Version 4.0 of the SWIID to the Development Policy and Analysis Division of the United Nations&amp;rsquo; Department of Economic and Social Affairs. I had some great conversations and got lots of useful feedback. Slides for the talk can be found here.</description>

      <title>SWIID Version 3.1 now available!</title>

      <description>Version 3.1 of the SWIID is now available here. The primary difference introduced in Version 3.1 is that the data on which the SWIID is based have again been expanded. Now nearly 4500 Gini observations are added to those collected in the UNU-WIDER data, and for many countries the available data extend to 2010. Also, I made one semantic change: to try to avoid confusion among those who neglect to read about the data they use, the series on pre-tax, pre-transfer inequality is now labeled gini_market rather than gini_gross.</description>

      <description>Version 3.0 of the SWIID is now available, with expanded coverage and improved estimates.
The data on which the SWIID is based have been expanded. I have collected another 2100 Gini observations (in addition to the 1500 added in v2.0), again with special attention to addressing the thinner spots in the WIID. As before, these data are available in the replication materials for those who are interested. Major sources for these data include the World Bank&amp;rsquo;s Povcalnet, the Socio-Economic Database for Latin America, Branko Milanovic&amp;rsquo;s World Income Distribution data (&amp;ldquo;All the Ginis&amp;rdquo;), and the ILO&amp;rsquo;s Household Income and Expenditure Statistics, but a multitude of national statistical offices and other sources were also consulted.</description>

      <title>Using the SWIID Standard Errors</title>
      <link>http://fsolt.org/blog/2010/06/20/using-swiid-ses/</link>

      <description>Incorporating the standard errors in the SWIID estimates into one&amp;rsquo;s analyses is the right thing to do, but it is not a trivial exercise. I myself have left it out of some work where I felt the model was already maxed out on complexity (though in such cases, I advise at least excluding observations with particularly large errors). The short story is that one generates a bunch of Monte Carlo simulations of the SWIID data from the estimates and standard errors, then analyses each simulation, then combines the results of the multiple analyses as one would in a multiple-imputation setup (this should be easier to do with Stata 11&amp;rsquo;s new multiple-imputation tools, but I won&amp;rsquo;t get my copy of Stata 11 until the fall&amp;ndash;oh well).</description>

      <description>Version 2.0 of the SWIID is now available, and it is a major upgrade. It introduces two important changes from Version 1.1 (the version described in the SSQ article). First, I collected a large number (1500+) of Gini observations that are excluded from the WIID with an eye towards addressing some of the thinner spots in the SWIID&amp;rsquo;s underlying data. Second, I rewrote several parts of the missing-data algorithm. The key change is a switch from multilevel to (flat) linear regression modeling for the imputation of conversion ratios between the 21 categories of available Gini data.</description>

      <description>So much for version control. With apologies to v1.0 users, Version 1.1 is the SWIID as reported in &amp;ldquo;Standardizing the World Income Inequality Database.&amp;rdquo;</description>
