title: Wait, how can I download the data again?
---

First, click on [this link](/swiid/swiid_downloads/). Scroll down past the description until you see a list of files. The dataset is a .zip file, the first one labeled "2. Data" (see the screenshot below). Clicking on the big rectangular button labeled "Download" on the right side of this line will download the file.
