title: Exploring the SWIID Source Data
---

[The SWIID's income inequality estimates](/swiid/swiid_downloads/) are based on [thousands of reported Gini indices from hundreds of published sources](/blog/2017/07/28/the-swiid-source-data/).  To explore these source data, choose a country; click on a series in the plot to display only that series in the table.  Links to the original sources can be found in the table.  The entire source dataset is also [available as a spreadsheet](https://github.com/fsolt/swiid/blob/master/data/swiid_source.csv).  If you spot any problems, or better still, know of sources I might have missed, _please_ [let me know](https://github.com/fsolt/swiid/issues/6).
