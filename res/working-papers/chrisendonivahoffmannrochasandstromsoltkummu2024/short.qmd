## Abstract

Income inequality is one of the most important measures to indicate economic health, social justice, and quality of life. Yet, especially at the subnational level, comprehensive global data on the distribution of incomes is widely missing. Such data is essential to assess patterns in inequality within countries and their development over time. We created seamless global subnational Gini coefficient and gross national income (GNI) PPP per capita datasets for 1990-2021 and used these to assess the status and trends of income inequality and income as well as their interplay. We show that while gross national income has increased for most (96%) people globally, inequality has also increased for around 68% of the global population. We illustrate heterogeneities in inequality trends between and within countries and analyse plausible confounding factors related to inequality. Our dataset and analyses reveal new insights into the issue, opening novel research avenues at the global, regional or national level and providing comprehensive evidence for policymakers to make informed decisions.
