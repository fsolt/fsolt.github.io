## Abstract

Income inequality is one of the most important measures to indicate economic health, social justice, and quality of life. Yet, especially at the subnational level, comprehensive global data on income distribution are widely missing. Such data are essential for assessing patterns of inequality within countries and their development over time. We created seamless global subnational Gini coefficient and gross national income (GNI) PPP per capita datasets for the period 1990-2023 and used these to assess the status and trends of income inequality and income, as well as their interplay. We show that while gross national income has increased for most people globally (96%), inequality has also increased for around 46-59% (depending on the national dataset used) of the global population, while it has decreased for 31-36% and has not shown significant trend for 10-18%. We illustrate heterogeneities in inequality trends between and within countries, analyse plausible confounding factors related to inequality, and highlight the broad utility of the datasets through a case study that investigates correlations with terrestrial ecological diversity. Our dataset and analyses reveal new insights into the issue, opening novel research avenues at the global, national, and subnational levels and providing comprehensive evidence for policymakers to make informed decisions.

![Figure 5. The interplay of ecological diversity, income, and income equality. a. a map showing the combinations of trends in ecological diversity, income, and income equality (1 – Gini coefficient) over 1990-2023. Bright spots (all trends positive) and dark spots (all trends negative) are highlighted. b. the distributions of average values (over 1990-2023) of each indicator in each trend combination class. In the last column, the n corresponds to the number of admin 1 areas in each trend combination class. Slopes were calculated with Siegel repeated medians (mblm R package), and only statistically significant slopes (p < 0.1) are reported. Note: The subnational Gini coefficient data based on SWIID national data are used here.](global_inequality_fig5.png)
